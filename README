This is the README for the Tripwire_driver

This is a cloud connected device which when activate fires a laser beam across and and detects when the beam is broken. It connects to the ninja cloud so is easily integrated with your other home security and automation devices.
Currently it is semi functional (must be manually armed via the terminal) the laser reports intruders via a sparkline in the Ninja Cloud. full cloud integration remains to be added.

Features:

• Single powered unit - The laser and sensor are in the same device, so only one unit needs to be powered

• Auto detecting set up mode to assist alignment of the tripwire

• Audio spoken feedback (ENGLISH)

• Wireless, connects to your local network via WIFI


Coming Soon:

• Arming, Disarming and Alarming through Ninja Cloud

• Programable button, choose to activate just the laser or the entire alarm system

• Pulse coding to catch people using another laser to foil the system

• Adaptive sensing to deal with changing light conditions
