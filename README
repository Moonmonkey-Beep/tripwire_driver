This is the dummies guide README for the Tripwire_driver
Sentences starting with $ indicate commands to be entered into the shell




**************SET UP SOFTWARE **************

Boot Raspberry Pi when connected to your router via ethernet cable
Connect via ethernet if WiFi is not working by typing the ssh command into the shell on your Mac or PC
The IP address for my RaspberryPi is 1.1.1.12, you need to check what yours is and replace it in the following code

$ssh pi@10.1.1.12

The password is:raspberry

The ninja pi should log in.

***Install dependencies***

$sudo apt-get install python-dev
INSTALLS PYTHON

$sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio
INSTALLS PYTHON GPIO CONTROLLER

$sudo apt-get install python-pip
INSTALLS PIP (HELPS INSTALL OTHER SOFTWARE)

$sudo apt-get install netatalk
MAKES THE TRIPWIRE APPEAR IN THE SIDEBAR OF LOCAL MACS

$sudo apt-get update
UPDATES EVERYTHING



***install Ninja Software***
$cd /opt/ninja/drivers/
CHANGE TO THE DRIVERS DIRECTORY

$sudo npm install -g ninja-toolbelt 
INSTALL NINJA TOOLBELT

$git clone git://github.com/moonmonkey/tripwire_driver.git
INSTALLS TRIPWIRE DRIVER

$cd /opt/ninja/drivers/tripwire_driver
CHANGES INTO THE DRIVERS DIRECTORY

$npm install
ACTIVATES THE DRIVER



***if you want to the device to be wireless***

$sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
THIS DELETES ANY OLD RULES PRESENT ONT THE DISTRIBUTION, THIS HELPS WIFI BE CONNECTED TO THE CORRECT NETWORK INTERFACE (ETHERNET WILL STILL WORK)

$sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
OPENS NETWORK INTERFACES SO YOU CAN ENTER YOUR WIFI NETWORK (SSID) AND PASSWORD

I suggest using this this code:
###############################
auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
   wpa-scan-ssid 1
   wpa-ap-scan 1
   wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK
   wpa-proto RSN WPA
   wpa-pairwise CCMP TKIP
   wpa-group CCMP TKIP
   wpa-ssid “your network”
   wpa-psk “your password”

iface default inet dhcp
###############################

Then restart the machine

$sudo reboot
